They are designed to mimic the way the human brain processes information, enabling machines to learn from data and make decisions. Here's a step-by-step guide to understanding how neural networks work:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Input Layer**\n- **What it is**: The first layer of the network, which receives the raw data.\n- **Function**: This layer simply passes the input data to the next layer. Each neuron in this layer represents one feature of the input.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Hidden Layers**\n- **What they are**: One or more",
